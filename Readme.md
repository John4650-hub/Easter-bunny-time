This is a simple HTML5 game where you play as the easter bunny but in this game instead of hiding eggs, you find them, there are 50 eggs that are hidden in the scene,
All you have to do is collect the eggs before you run out of time. I have estimated that you will only need 1 minute for 10 eggs hence you are given 300 seconds to complete your task.

Have fun playing my game and happy Easter celebrations.
